  <title>Virtual Image Transfer Software</title>
  <para>This chapter describes the software components that have
  been and need to be developed to complete cross site image
  transfer.</para>
  <para>The software and implementation is only one of many posible solutions that could be 
    produced to solve the objectives of the &vwg;.</para>

    <title>Inter Site Image Transfer</title>
    <para>The image list transfer software is based upon X509 signed image lists containing 
      sha512 hashes.</para>

        <title>Status</title>
        <para>This software is available at:</para>
        <code>https://github.com/hepix-virtualisation/hepixvmilsubscriber</code>
        <para>The software is based upon a simple database that stores subscriptions to image lists,
          who can sign the image list, and which images belong to which susbctiptions. It allows 
          images to selected for subscription.</para>
        <para>Subscribed images can be downloaded verified and cached. Cached images can be verified,
          and if invalid or expired they are moved to an expiry directory.</para>
        <para>This program will not provide an interface for admins to manage which images will be 
          approved by the site as this functionality is provided by the VMIC. Thsi software is rather 
          a mechanism upon which tools such as the VMIC may select locally cached images for the 
          perposes of running on the local farm.</para>

          </itemizedlist>
          <para>While it does check the authenticity of the message using X509, at the moment the 
            authenticity of the host is unchecked. Programatically it would be far simpler to 
            use x509 certificates to check the host server. In terms of deployment it would be far 
            easyer just to check any host key mechanism, as this is sufficent.</para>

          <note>Both the producer of an image and the site produce signed list of images, 
            these provide different functions, the image is signed by the producer to show 
            to the site the image came from the producer, while the site may sign a list 
            of images to allow them to be run at a site.</note>
