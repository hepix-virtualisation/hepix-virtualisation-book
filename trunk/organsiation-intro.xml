    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>Several &hep; pilot projects had already shown that CPU intensive tasks could easily run on a cloud 
    infrastructure. Members of the group use &opennebula;, &nimbus;, &eucalyptus; and some are evaluating 
    &openstack;. With such a diversity of cloud solutions all under going very active development it is 
    impossible for a group such as &vwg; to only support a single cloud implementation, as we would not be 
    serving the needs to our community.</para>
    <para>The &hep; community have long used batch computing models to maximise computing efficiency, this 
    allows jobs to be queued so that each compute node is always occupied. &hep; sites have typically 
    optimised their batch queues so that different user communities can benefit from under utilised resources 
    from other user groups, while retaining a quota of CPU usage proportional to their budget, so called 
    &fss;. It was noted that &hep; users on Clouds typically installed batch queues to maximise their job 
    efficiency but since resources where tied to a single customer it is not possible to use &fss;.</para>

    <title>Scope</title>
    <para>Since &hep; is very conserned with job effciency and has been well served by the batch queue model 
    of computing it was seen that the &vwg; cannot limit thier effort to only working with cloud based solutions 
    and our work scope should be equally applicable to Cloud and &vee; on a batch queue compute node.</para>
    <para>One of the side effects of &hep; having pioneared Grid computing, is that the comunity have already 
    learnt about the diversity of sites, and considerable effort has been put into minimising the diffeerances 
    between sites from a customer perspective. The &hep; comunity and sites serving them have come to understand 
    that some areas of site management are not practical to unify. In areas where tools and practices are 
    developing quickly inovation is potentially hindered by enforsing standardisation. This is also true of 
    areas where considerable effort has been invested, and change woudl be detrimental, a good example of this 
    is in site deployment and configuration. The &vwg; decided very early on that we where not going to look 
    into areas that would effect sites local deployment and configuration. The rational was that many sites 
    already had virtulisation stratgies, and sites that did not, should not be prevented from working with newer 
    tools and clound infrastructures.</para>
